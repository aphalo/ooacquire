# Acquire spectral irradiance or fluence from a continuous light source
# triggering a camera, a flash or other device with a YoctoRelay USB module
# accessed through a local Yoctopuce VirtualHub or a remote YoctoPuce hub.
#
# In these simple use case a simple (default?) configuration of the YoctoRelay
# works. The module has two relays with logical names "Relay1" and "Relay2"
# assigned, and we use "Relay1".
#
# Configuration used:
# logicalName: RELAY1
# stateAtPowerOn: A
# maxTimeOnStateA: 0.000 [s]
# maxTimeOnStateB: 0.000 [s]
# output: ON
# pulseTimer: 0.000 [s]
# delayedPulseTimer: none
# countdown: 0.000 [s]
#
# The serial number of the module plus function name, can be used instead of the
# logical name, must be included as part of the URL. Assigning a logical name to
# the module function, as I have done for this example, makes the code agnostic
# about module serial numbers.
#
# To use a remote hub, simply replace "localhost" by the hub's URL.
#
# The delay value to use will depend on the speed of the camera to arm the
# shutter, with an electronic released shutter this is in the order of tens of
# milliseconds. Delays and pulse durations as short as 1 ms seen to work
# reliably.
#
# Cameras used in tests: Olympus E-M1, EM-1 II, OM-1 (digital)
# Camera trigger: direct cable
# Relay module: Yoctopuce YoctoRelay
# Spectrometer: Ocean Optics Maya 2000Pro
#
# Using a "stereo" 2.5mm connected as used by Canon, Pentax and recent
# Olympus/OM cameras seems to be also the most common approach with independent
# manufacturers of wired camera remotes. The expectation is a switch closure so
# no additional components are needed except for the connector. The wiring of
# the jack is as follows: base = common (ground for audio), middle = focus "half
# press", (audio R/right/"red" channel), tip = shutter release (audio
# L/left/"white" channel). In the Yocto-Relay I connected IN1 and IN2 to the
# base of the jack, B2 to the middle of the jack, and B1 to the tip. A1 and A2
# not connected.
#
# Below I define a simple pulse function for using a YoctoRelay USB module to
# automatically trigger a camera each time a spectrum is acquired. This makes it
# possible to take photographs nearly synchronously with the spectral data
# acquisition.
#
# Perfect synchronization is not possible as the spectrometer returns the most
# recent spectrum measured with the current settings, which will be in most
# cases am acquisition started before the R function requested it. In addition,
# because of what looks like competition for USB access between the spectrometer
# and the virtual hub, the relay module is not always on-line immediately after
# a spectrum has been acquired, so the functions defined below have a "sleep
# loop" that waits for at most approximately 20 ms for the relay module to be
# back on line.
#
# The argument passed to parameter delay delays the switching of the relay but
# not the acquisition of spectra, making it possible to trigger the flash or
# camera while a spectrum is being acquired by the spectrometer on a different
# USB port.

# Further possibilities ---------------------------------------------------
#
# A camera and flash trigger, such as HÃ¤hnel CAPTUR Module Pro, can be set to add a
# delay or issue multiple triggers when triggered through its "aux" input. It
# could be used to take multiple images per spectrum. Modern cameras can be
# programmed for time-lapse photography and/or burst modes, adding
# possibilities. The OM-1 camera can, for example, take 50 photographs per
# second at full resolution and nearly 240 photographs per second at lower
# resolution. Depending on the settings, manual or auto exposure settings can be
# used in the camera.
#
# Some electronic flashes have a stroboscope mode allowing a rapid sequence of
# light flashes on a single trigger event.
#
# The relay module could be used to trigger multiple flashes if the R trigger
# function runs concurrently in a different R session using R package 'mirai'. I
# am not sure if this approach is able to allow accurate synchronization or
# stable running for a long time.
