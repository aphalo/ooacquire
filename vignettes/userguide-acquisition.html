<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This package supports direct acquisition of spectra only from Ocean
Optics spectrometers. It also allows some computations on RAW spectral
counts to be done with the spectrometer off-line. What distinguishes it
from other software is the implementation of special algorithms for
measurement protocols that enhance the signal to noise ratio by one
order of magnitude, allowing the measurement of ultraviolet-B radiation
in sunlight using array spectrometers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows spectral data acquisition from within an R session in near
real-time.</li>
<li>Allows conversion of raw-counts data acquired using SpectraSuite or
OceanView on PCs and possibly using the open-source SeaBreeze based
software running on the Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer. It also
supports computations based on files acquired autonomously with the Jaz
spectrometer.</li>
<li>Irradiance, fluence, reflectance, transmittance, absorptance and
absorbance can be derived from raw spectra.</li>
<li>Measurements of both continuous and pulsed light sources is
possible.</li>
<li>Different measurement protocols, data averaging, integration time
bracketing, automatic adjustment of integration time can be used and
corrections for stray light and slit function can be applied.</li>
<li>Acquisition of time series of spectra is also possible in two
different ways: at timed intervals, or as fast as possible using
buffered transfer from the spectrometer. The minimum delay depends on
the spectrometer but can be as short as a few microseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not directly supported by this package, the code it includes
can serve as a basis for equivalent protocols and corrections of data
acquired with software and/or spectrometers from other suppliers.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes only high level functions for interactive
data acquisition. We first show simple examples of their use, assuming
that R, the needed R packages, the Temurin 8 <strong>OpenJDK</strong> or
Oracle’s Java 8 <strong>JDK</strong> and Ocean Optics’ free OmniDriver
runtime are all installed and working (see this package’s README and the
README of package ‘rOmniDriver’ for details).</p>
<p>In this vignette we provide a tutorial on how to carry out
measurements. Please, see the vignette <em>Algorithms</em> for the
details on the computations.</p>
<p>The package exports both high level user-friendly functions and the
lower level functions used to build them. What we describe here is the
use of the higher level functions.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This vignette can be built even if a
spectrometer is not connected as the code chunks with code that “talks”
with the instrument are by default not evaluated. Set above
<code>sr.online &lt;- TRUE</code> and connect a spectrometer for which a
calibration is available if you intend to rebuild this vignette with
live output from a measurement session.</p>
</div>
<div id="measurement-of-light-spectra" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement of light spectra</h2>
<p>An emission spectrum of light emmited by a source or the spectrum of
light received on a surface describes the energy or photon distribution
as a function of wavelength. A calibration describes the relationship
between the signal response of a sensor and a physical quantity. For
spectral measurements this involves a description of the response of the
spectrometer to light of each measurable wavelength and a calibration of
detector pixels or monochromator positions to true wavelengths</p>
<p>Thus to acquire spectral irradiance, a suitable instrument
calibration and correction method description should be also available
and in practice implemented in software. Advanced algorithms implemented
in ‘ooacquire’ require a special characterization of the spectrometer.
If such characterization is not available, a simpler approach, as
normally used with most other software, is also available in
‘ooacquire’. If no calibration is available in the format used by this
package, an attempt is made to retrieve calibration data from the
connected spectrometer. In most cases the wavelength calibration can be
retrieved, but the multipliers needed to compute spectral irradiance are
stored in memory only if expressly saved for this type of measurements
as a result of a calibration. An irradiance calibration is not needed to
measure quantities like spectral reflectance and transmittance that are
relative to a reference. Protocols, characterization and calibration
information can all be stored once in the special format used by
‘ooacquire’ if available. Subsequently, the acquisition of spectra does
not differ much and any differences are reflected in the user interface
as long as a calibration is available. What differs is the quality of
the spectral data that is acquired.</p>
<p>In the code chunks below we use calibrations included as part of the
package. As the serial number stored with the calibration is validated
against that retrieved from the instrument, the examples below will work
only with our own instruments, rather than with the ones you may intend
to use. In most cases you will need to either import calibration data as
provided by Ocean Optics/Ocean Insight or for more complex correction
algorithms, manually create R objects with calibration and
characterisation data obtained from other sources. Such setup needs to
be done only once, and updated when the spectrometer is
recalibrated.</p>
<p>When sunlight or radiation emitted by lamps driven by direct or
alternating current are measured the integration time can be used as
reference to compute fluxes such as energy irradiance or photon
irradiance. In the case of many lamps driven by alternating current
accurate measurements require us to consider the line frequency (50 Hz
in Europe, 60 Hz in USA) because light output will usually vary
cyclically at twice these frequencies (100 Hz or 120 Hz) making it
necessary to use integration times that are multiples of the durantion
of one half cycle of line frequency (10 ms and 8.3333 ms, respectively)
or alternatively use long-enough integration times for several cycles to
be included in the measurement interval. The same considerations apply
to transmittance, reflectance, and absorptance measurements using
continuous radiation sources.</p>
<p>When measuring radiation from pulsed light sources such as xenon
flashes we express the measurements as spectral power or photons per
event (pulse or “flash”) and the integration time must simply be long
enough to encompass a known number of <em>whole</em> pulses. We use the
number of pulses to compute fluence rate per pulse or event. The same
considerations apply to transmittance, reflectance and absorptance
measurements using pulsed radiation sources.</p>
<p>The functions described below by default acquire for each measurement
event one or more raw-counts spectra from the spectrometer. They compute
the corresponding spectrum or spectra expressed in a physical quantity,
and save the data, both raw and computed, immediately, creating one
<code>.Rda</code> R-data file per measurement event. The operator is
presented with an annotated plot, with annotations that the user can
adjust before continuing for example choosing energy vs. photon units.
The plot corresponding to the measurement is saved to a
<code>.pdf</code> file, also before a new measurement is started. This
approach to saving the data ensures that in case of a computer failure
or program crash, at most data for a single measurement event will be
lost.</p>
<p>Spectra grouped into collections can be also saved and plotted at any
time during a measurement session. When saving a collection all spectra
are collected into a <code>.mspct</code> object, a summary of the
measurements is computed and an index to the spectra compiled. All these
R objects are saved into a single <code>.Rda</code> file.</p>
<p>A measurement event can consist of a single <em>“light”</em> spectrum
or of a time series of <em>“light”</em> spectra, sharing the same
<em>“dark”</em> and <em>“filter”</em> spectra used as reference for
their conversion into spectral irradiance. Each raw- or
instrument-counts spectrum can consist in one or more scans or readings
of the detector array, taken using identical or different settings in
the spectrometer. Once the desired protocol is selected, the
measurements can be acquired with little intervention from the user, and
the settings are retained across successive measurement events, unless
expressly modified.</p>
<p>Whether a time series of spectra or a single spectra is acquired
depends on the argumentes passed to parameters of the function.</p>
<table>
<caption>Timing of the acquisition of spectra. Buffered acquisition is
as fast as the spectromter allows, with the frequency controlled by the
total integration time plus an overhead &lt; 1 ms. In the case of
Buffered acquisition there is minimal dead time between acquisitions.
Fast acquisition has more dead time as settings in the spectrometer need
to we modified two or more times per measuring event. While Buffered and
Fast series are acquired as fast as possible, in the case of a timed
series, spectra are retrieved at specific times, with dead time
in-between.</caption>

<ul>
<li><code>&quot;raw&quot;</code> skips computations of spectra in physical units
and saves to file only raw-counts data with metadata. In this conversion
into physical units must be done at a later time. The descriptor of the
instrument if missing is retrieved from the instrument.</li>
<li><code>&quot;cps&quot;</code> (default if no spectral irradiance calibration is
available) converts raw-counts into linearized counts-per-second and
saves to file both raw-counts data with metadata and counts-per second
spectral data. The descriptor of the instrument if missing is retrieved
from the instrument.</li>
<li><code>&quot;irrad&quot;</code> (default if a spectral irradiance calibration
is available) converts raw-counts into corrected spectral irradiance (a
flux rate expressed per unit time) and saves to a file both raw-counts
data with metadata and spectral irradiance data. If the descriptor and
spectral irradiance calibration are not available in R but available in
the memory of the instrument they are retrieved.</li>
<li><code>&quot;fluence&quot;</code> same as “irrad”`, but the quantity computed
is spectral fluence (a flux expressed per measuring event).</li>

<h2>Spectral irradiance</h2>
<p>Spectral energy irradiance (<span class="math inline">\(W m^{-2}
nm^{-1}\)</span>) and spectral photon irradiance (<span class="math inline">\(mol s^{-1} m^{m-2} nm^{-1}\)</span>$) are fluxes
expressed as energy or quanta, respectively per unit area of a receiving
surface. They can be inter-converted and there is no difference in how
they are measured or a need for different calibration.</p>
<p>After loading the package as shown in the next section below and
connecting a spectrometer by USB, calling function
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> opens a connection to the
spectroometer and starts an interactive spectral-data acquisition
session. The function takes several arguments, which have as defaults
the most frequently used values. The <code>correction.method</code> and
<code>descriptor</code> parameters are used to pass the calibration and
protocol information specific to a given spectrometer. For spectrometers
“known” to package ‘ooacquire’ these also have suitable defaults which
are selected after quering from the spectrometer its serial number.
These parameters are not totally redundant as for a given spectrometer
multiple correction algorithms, calibrations for different entrance
optics, may be available and selected by overriding the defaults. In all
cases these arguments are checked to match the serial number of the
attached spectrometer, and rejected in cases of mismatch.</p>
<p>If this test fails or no calibration information is available and the
user has not explicitly supplied the information as arguments to the
call, an attempt is made to retrieve a calibration from the spectrometer
EEPROM. Because of the way in which irradiance calibrations are stored
in Ocean Optics spectrometers, calibration data retireved from the
EEPROM can only be used if the user provides information about the
diffuser used as entrance optics, and assuming that the calibration is
valid, thus among other things, done using the same optical fibre as in
being used for the measurements. If a calibration cannot be retrieved
from the EEPROM or information about the diffuser is not supplied, this
last attempt also fails, the function falls back into a mode that
returns counts-per-second instead of spectral irradiance, with a
warning. A wavelength calibration remains as a requirement but it rarely
missing.</p>

<h3>Acquiring a single irradiance spectrum</h3>
<div id="a-simple-example" class="section level4">
<h4>A simple example</h4>
<p>Assuming a calibration is available the minimal steps to measure
spectral irradiance are as follows.</p>
<p>0 If R and RStudio are not already installed, install their latest
versions. If not already installed, install the 64 bit Java 8 JDK (Java
development kit; the JRE runtime is not enough). Install the OmniDriver
runtime. Install package ‘rJava’ and test that it is working, by running
some of the examples in its documentation. Install from CRAN package
‘ggspectra’ that will install most of the necessary dependencies.
Finally install packages ‘rOmniDriver’ and ‘ooacquire’, preferably by
anabling the repository located at (<a href="https://r.r4photobiology.info" class="uri">https://r.r4photobiology.info</a>) (see the README files for
instructions).</p>
<p>1 Start R and load the package. We also change the default reporting
of warnings by R so that they are printed without the delay.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(ooacquire)</span>

<p>2 Connect an Ocean Optics spectrometer to a USB port. To avoid
problems use a short and high quality USB cable, if this is not possible
use an active USB extension cable. In all cases use a short and known
good USB cable when using ‘ooacquire’ or a given spectrometer for the
first time and later keep this short and good USB cable always at hand
to debug any possible USB connection problems if they happen.</p>
<p>3 Start an interactive measuring session, in this example accepting
all defaults except for the choice of a simplified user interface.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">interface.mode =</span> <span class="st">&quot;simple&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If everything works as expected, the version of OmniDriver that has
been found will be reported. If one or more spectrometers are found,
they will be listed with their serial numbers for the user to choose one
of them. Once a connection and software are initialized data acquisition
is possible.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Follow the prompts to acquire spectra.</li>
</ol>
<p>Default settings allow flexibility as settings can be interactively
set, but this leads to a rather verbose interface. If one knows in
advance what settings will use, these can be set when starting the
session by passing arguments that become the new defaults.</p>
<p>The code above is run at the R console or by sourcing a simple
script. I normally use the RStudio IDE, but this is not required as long
as graphical display is enabled. The statements can be saved into an R
script (as a plain-text file) and then the file <em>sourced</em>. As
scripts can be also run from the operating system shell or command
prompt, it is possible, if desired to partly hide this step from users’
view by writing a batch file or shell script.</p>
<p>Of the formal parameters of function
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code>, <code>interface.mode</code>
selects different sets of settings to be controlled interactively during
a session. The difference between the interface modes is mostly in which
of the different possible settings can be modified by the user at run
time (in other words, it alters which options are visible or not in
menus as well as some of the default settings). The simplified
interfaces make measurements simpler and faster in specific situations,
while the defaults for the session can always be changed by passing
arguments when calling the function. The default
<code>interface.mode = &quot;auto&quot;</code> retains the behaviour of earlier
versions, but in many cases <code>interface.mode = &quot;simple&quot;</code> will
still give access to all the parameters that need to be set at runtime
for common measurements. Modes <code>&quot;manual&quot;</code> and
<code>&quot;full&quot;</code> make it possible to manually set the integration
time, while “series” makes it possible to acquire time series of spectra
as a single measurement event.</p>
<p>In all cases when values supplied by the user fall outside those
accepted by the connected instrument, these values will be adjusted to
the nearest valid value.</p>
<p>We can pass the objects containing the correction method definition
and the instrument descriptor that includes the calibration data as
arguments.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">correction.method =</span> ooacquire<span class="sc">::</span>MAYP11278_ylianttila.mthd,</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                      <span class="at">descriptors =</span> ooacquire<span class="sc">::</span>MAYP11278_descriptors)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, this corresponds to a spectrometer whose data are
available in the package and recognized automatically. Thus is
equivalent to accepting all defaults as below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, for this spectrometer additional correction methods are
available. Two calibrations with different entrance optics are
available, and can be selected by means of an argument passed to
parameter <code>entrance.optics</code>.</p>
<p>In the case of calibrations done by Ocean Insight or with their
software, and retrieved from the spectrometer EEPROM we need to pass an
argument to parameter <code>area</code> indicating the effective area of
the diffuser, or the one of one of the types known to ‘ooacquire’.</p>
<p>The interface mode can be also selected only when call the function.
The default is <code>&quot;auto&quot;</code> for automatic integration-time
tuning, <code>&quot;manual&quot;</code> for manual setting of the integration
time, <code>&quot;series&quot;</code> for the acquisition of time series of
spectra. Mode <code>&quot;simple&quot;</code> is a simplified version of
<code>&quot;auto&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Although we discuss settings in relation to arguments to parameters,
the settings discussed below can be also set interactively by the user,
at least in one of the supported interface modes. The functions
described here, except when in interface mode <code>&quot;manual&quot;</code>,
will set a suitable integration time automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="protocols-for-enhanced-performance" class="section level4">
<h4>Protocols for enhanced performance</h4>
<p>Dynamic range is the difference between the smallest and largest
values that can be detected in a measurement. Noise is the component of
the measured value that is not a reflection of what we want to measure.
An array detector not only responds to light, but it is also to a small
extent excited also by thermal radiation, electrical fields and even
cosmic particles. These events are infrequent and so during a single
integration are likely to affect only individual pixels and different
pixels in different integrations. A further problem is stray light,
photons that imping on the “wrong” pixel because of internal reflections
in the optical bench of the spectrometer. Different protocols and
correction algorithms can mitigate the effect of these problems on the
quality of the spectral data.</p>
<p>If we use a single value for integration time (the equivalent of
exposure time in a photographic camera) the realized dynamic range is
the intrinsic dynamic range of the array detector and electronics of the
spectrometer. In this case we pass a single numeric value as argument to
<code>HDR.mult</code> to indicate acquisition using a single integration
time. Except in very unusual cases, we use 1, because
<code>HDR.mult</code> is a multiplicative factor applied to the optimal
integration time.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">HDR.mult =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>,</span>

<p>Averaging of multiple “scans” mitigates “random” noise because the
longer the total measurement time the most likely it is that all pixels
are similarly affected by the noise. The noise is still present, but it
affects more evenly the different pixels. The approach used in
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> is for the user to supply an upper
and lower limit to the sum of integration times from multiple scans and
the software determines the number of scans that are needed at the time
the optimal integration time is assessed. Keeping the
<code>tot.time.range</code> constant can help keep the noise levels
constant.</p>
<p>The argument passed to <code>tot.time.range</code>, a vector of one
or two numbers, indicates the allowed range for total time in seconds.
If two identical numbers or a single number are passed, this exact time
is used. The integration time for individual scans is adjusted
automatically to ensure good performance of the instrument and used to
compute the number of scans to average. The maximum and minimum
integration times supported by the spectrometer hardware set the
effective limits for the integration time. The smallest argument
accepted for <code>tot.time.range</code> is zero and the largest
<code>Inf</code>. Setting <code>tot.time.range = c(0, Inf)</code> as in
the example above ensures that only one integration per measurement will
be used, and that the integration times used will be from the whole
range the spectrometer supports.</p>
<p>It would be possible to use in the example above a value larger than
one for <code>HDR.mult</code> even if a single integration time is used.
This is unusual, but if we indeed would like to force clipping of part
of the spectrum, this would be the way to achieve this automatically
relative to the optimum setting.</p>
<p>The dynamic range in the spectral data can be increased by splicing
spectra measured using increasing integration times (similar to
“exposure bracketing” as used in photography followed by merging to
ensure enough detail is captured in both shade and highlights). In most
cases for this to significantly improve the quality of the spectral data
we also need to average data from several successive integrations to
control the noise. The default in <code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code>
are thus to use the optimal integration time plus one ten times longer
and to keep the total measuring time, the sum of multiple integration
events, between 5 and 10 s.</p>

<p>The resulting spectra are merged choosing the <em>most suitable</em>
of the used integration times for each wavelength region. Usually using
two integration times with 1 and 10 as <code>HDR.mult</code> is a good
compromise. However, there is no built-in limitation in the package code
making it possible to use a vector of two, three, four or more values,
which combined with a very long total acquisition time of the order of
minutes, can yield very good control of noise for light sources with
stable output. Consequently, although the default setting
<code>HDR.mult = c(1, 10)</code> tends to work well, settings like
<code>HDR.mult = c(1, 5, 25)</code> may be useful in special
circumstances.</p>
<p>We next set total acquisition time to a fixed length of 10 seconds.
Once this setting is active, each time the integration time is
automatically set, both the integration time and number of scans are
adjusted so that total acquisition time is exactly 10 seconds, for both
short and long integration times. Averaging multiple scans smooths out
noise but retains the spectral resolution. A constant total measurement
time is useful as it controls the influence of “noise” on the acquired
data consistently irrespective of the integration time used.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">HDR.mult =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>),</span>

<p>If long integration times are needed, the setting above may result in
the use of suboptimal integration times, as the desired integration time
may have be to be shortened until it becomes an exact fraction of the
total acquisition time. To avoid this, we can supply instead of a single
fixed value for the total acquisition time, a range of values.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">HDR.mult =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>), </span>

<p>Sometimes we may want to avoid long integration times even at the
cost of not using the whole dynamic range of the detector. For example,
when following some fast kinetics, we would usually need the integration
time not to exceed a certain time, say 50 milliseconds, we would simply
use smaller values, such as
<code>tot.time.range = c(0.03, 0.05)</code>.</p>
<p>One problem with automatic setting of integration time is that
depending on the stability of the light source we will need to set a
different value for the target relative to the longest integration time
that would result in no clipping during automatic tuning. Parameter
<code>target.margin</code> allows the user to set a <em>safety
margin</em> different from the default of 0.1 (or 10%). The example
below could help prevent clipping in cases when irradiance changes so
fast that it could be up to 25% higher during actual measurement than
during the preceding tuning of the integration time.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">target.margin =</span> <span class="fl">0.25</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although above we described the use of <code>HDR.mult</code> as a
step in splicing spectra, it is also possible at a later time also the
discard spectra acquired using specific multipliers and recalculate the
irradiance. In some cases with extremely variable light levels when
acquiring time series of spectra, it can be wise to use a rather wide
range of values in the vector passed to <code>HDR.mult</code>, which
also accepts values smaller than one, achieving a similar effect as
<code>target.margin</code> (<code>target.margin = 0.25</code> is
equivalent to <code>HDR.mult = 0.75</code>).</p>
<p>The automatic tuning step can be also skipped. For example the value
used in the previous measurement event can be reused.</p>
<p>None of the approaches described above can control stray light caused
by reflections in the optical bench. Correction for stray light in the
case of some spectrometers makes it necessary to measure it using a
short pass filter. The function also supports this type of protocols
with two references, and uses it for two spectrometers to allow the
measurement of UV-B radiation in sunlight.</p>

<h3>Acquiring a time series of irradiance spectra</h3>
<p>Measuring a time series of irradiance spectra using the approaches
described above can be difficult. Triggering acquisition of spectra at
regular intervals manually is difficult for long time steps and
impossible for very short ones. In most cases we also need to measure
many light spectra for each “dark” reference measurement. Interface mode
<code>&quot;series&quot;</code> introduced in version 0.3.0 of ‘ooacquire’ and
enhanced in laters versions targets this type of measurements.</p>
<p>For measuring a time series, we pass
<code>interface.mode = &quot;series&quot;</code> in the call to
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code>. We can set the default parameters
for the series through arguments. The following example sets the default
for a series with measuring events triggered at the start of each
minute, with 60 s time step between successive <code>&quot;light&quot;</code>
spectra and 60 spectra, for a total time expanse of 1 h. We also set the
initial delay to zero, so that once we start the light measurement event
by pressing enter, the acquisition of the time series starts at the
beginning of the next minute.</p>

<p>That the acquisition of spectra is continuously running in the
spectrometer is something to be aware of, because it means that this is
what determines the true time step between successively retrieved
spectra and that, say using a <code>step.delay</code> that is not a
multiple of the frequency at which the spectrometer is acquiring the
spectra will result only in missing the retrieval of some of the spectra
measured by the spectrometer, but not in a different effective time
step! In other words with short time steps we need to be aware that new
spectra are acquired at time steps that are a multiple of the
<strong>integration time</strong> setting of the spectrometer plus some
small overhead that depends on the model of the spectrometer. This is
tricky as the length of the integration time needs to be adjusted based
on irradiance. The problem barely exists if we average multiple spectra
during a measurement, or the time step includes some idle time between
acquisitions.</p>
<p>The OmniDriver API contains special functions for acquisition of
spectra at high speed. These functions store the spectra in a computer
memory buffer for later retrieval by user code, minimizing the overhead,
but they do not allow control over the timing of successively acquired
spectra. The <code>&quot;series&quot;</code> mode uses them only for
<code>step.delay = 0</code> and no HDR integration time bracketing. In
all other cases normal API functions are used so as to allow the use of
HDR bracketing or the choice of the time step between successive
acquisitions of spectra. Because, of how OO array spectrometers work,
some limitations exist. When using <code>step.delay = 0</code> the time
step is controlled by the length of the measurement, or the integration
time if spectra are not averaged for each measurement.</p>
<p>In my test with a specific PC under Windows 10 together with a
USB2000 spectrometer and without bracketing I was able to use a minimum
<code>step.delay = 0.052</code> with <code>tot.time.range = 0.050</code>
with <code>HDR.mult = 1</code>. From these tests I infer that the
USB2000 spectrometer is constantly measuring spectra with an overhead of
<span class="math inline">\(2\,ms\)</span> (this delay is even shorter
in modern spectrometer models) and that the overhead incurred by
‘ooacquire’ in reading a spectrum is less than 50 ms.</p>
<p>In the memory buffered mode with a Maya 2000 Pro I was able to
measure using an integration time of <span class="math inline">\(7.2\,ms\)</span> a series with a median time step
of less than 7.23 ms or an overhead of less than <span class="math inline">\(30\,\mu s\)</span>. However, I observed some small
variation in the length of succesive time step across a series. Anyway
time stamps are saved with a resolution of <span class="math inline">\(1\,\mu s\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The time overhead depends on the spectrometer, the PC and
most likely the operating system and possibly the version of OmniDriver,
Java, R and ‘ooacquire’. Consequently before attempting measurements
using <code>step.delay</code> values that are not much longer than the
largest value in the vector passed to <code>tot.time.range</code>, some
experimentation will be needed. The package attempts to detect
<code>step.delay</code> values that are too short to be achieved and
overrides them with <code>step.delay = 0</code></strong>.</p>
<p>When using HDR-integration-time bracketing, the spectrometer is not
free running or continuously acquiring spectra. Settings need to be
changed, acquisition of spectra restarted and the spectral data
subsequently acquired only after a freshly measured spectrum is
available. This adds a lot of overhead compared to retrieving spectra
that are being measured by the spectrometer using multitasking while the
PC is busy with other tasks, such as retrieving the previous spectrum.
Furthermore, this also means that when using HDR bracketing, the
overhead depends on the <code>tot.time.range</code> and
<code>HDR.mult</code> settings and on the integration time. In contrast,
when the settings are not modified between successively acquired spectra
the overhead is much less and less dependent on the integration time and
arguments passed to other parameters.</p>
<p>So with care about choosing matching integration times and
<code>step.delay</code> values without HDR bracketing one can achieve as
little as 50 ms between acquired spectra at timed steps. However, when
using HDR bracketing, a rough guide is that the minimum time step that
can be achieved is about twice the sum of the summed integration time
values used. When <code>tot.time.range</code> is set as a range, then
the longest time should be considered as limiting.</p>
<p>The high speed acquisition mode retrieves as quickly as possible the
spectra as they are acquired, and the time step is simply the
integration time plus the spectrometer overhead. To enable this mode we
use <code>step.delay = 0</code>. The time stamp used for spectra in
‘ooacquire’ until version 0.3.0 has been the time when spectra are
retrieved from the spectrometer. This is close enough for most
individual measurements and series with time steps of several seconds,
but when dealing with fast time series this can be inadequate. If
<code>step.delay = 0</code> is used, the time for the first spectrum is
set when the retrieval into the memory buffer is started, but the times
for the later spectra are set based on time differences computed from
time stamps retrieved from OmniDriver. The theoretical time resolution
is better than a microsecond for objects of R’s class
<code>POSIXct</code>, and this class is used in package ‘photobiology’
to record acquisition times.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Measurement of series of spectra with single dark and filter
measurements makes it imperative that the functioning of the
spectrometer is stable. Consequently, when measuring series, specially
if they are longer than a few seconds, do make sure that the temperature
of the spectrometer has stabilized and that it remains stable throught
the acquisition of the series. For example, protect the spectrometer
from direct sunlight or other sources of energy that can increase its
temperature, while allowing ventilation to allow the dissipation of the
heat generated by the spectrometer itself. Of course, active temperature
control is the best approach. Passive temperature equalization can take
30 to 45 min if the difference between the storage temperature and the
temperature under which the spectrometer is used is large (e.g., more
than 10 C).</strong></p>
<p><strong>As the spectrometer electronics dissipate energy, even when
used at the same temperature at which it was stored, the spectrometer
should be allowed to warm up for 10 to 20 minutes before attempting to
measure a time series. Although allowing the spectrometer to warm up for
several minutes is always beneficial, when a single reference dark
measurement is used for a series of light measurements, it is crucial
that the dark reference is not invalidated by changes in the temperature
of the spectrometer.</strong></p>

<div id="spectral-fluence" class="section level3">
<h3>Spectral fluence</h3>
<p>Function <code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> has replaced function
<code>acq_fluence_interactive</code>. Fluence spectra are returned by
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> when
<code>qty.out = &quot;fluence&quot;</code>. Some of the defaults for other
parameters also change. Otherwise all the functionality described above
for irradiance measurements is avaialable except the
<code>&quot;series&quot;</code> interface mode.</p>
<p>If the duration of the exposure to a continuous light source is
known, then spectral irradiance multiplied by this time duration gives
spectral fluence, and can be obtained by measuring spectral irradiance
as described in the previous section. In this section we discuss the
case when spectral fluence is measured directly, using an integration
time that encompasses the whole duration of the irradiation event,
especially when the duration of this event is unknown or spectral
irradiance varies through the irradiation event and we are interested in
the accumulated exposure or “dose”.</p>
<p>Fluence, also called radiant exposure, is defined per exposure event
rather than per unit time. When measuring pulsed light sources, the
length of exposure is determined by the duration of the pulse, which is
usually not known with precision. In the discussion below we assume that
the quantity of interest is fluence per pulse. For this type of
measurements the integration time setting in the spectrometer only
affects the window within which pulses will be measured, consequently,
it is always set manually. The way of controlling the number of photons
reaching the detector during an integration is through the number of
pulses per integration and/or the fluence provided by each pulse (e.g.,
by altering the distance between source and instrument entrance optics
or the power settings of the source).</p>
<p>We start the session as described above for irradiance, but using
function <code>acq_fluence_interactive()</code>. Using defaults except
for <code>qty.out</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">acq_irrad_interactive</span>(<span class="at">qty.out =</span> <span class="st">&quot;fluence&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The integration time can be set when calling the function to start a
session or leter interactively.</p>
<p>Another important parameter is the number of exposure events. This
determines how the resulting data are expressed. If we consider that
each individual pulse is an exposure event, and for example, we trigger
five flashes per spectrometer integration (or “scan”), we would set
<code>num.exposures = 5</code>.</p>
<p>By default the user is prompted to manually trigger a pulse. However,
when triggering of pulses can be automated, a function accepting as only
argument the number of pulses can be passed as argument to parameter
<code>f.trigger.pulses</code>. <strong>It is important to be aware that
no multitasking support is provided, so for automation, the pulse
trigger function should return to the caller before the pulses are
triggered and the train of pulses start with enough delay for the
integration to be started before them.</strong></p>

<div id="spectral-transmittance-absorptance-and-reflectance" class="section level3">
<h3>Spectral transmittance, absorptance and reflectance</h3>
<p><strong>Several features available in
<code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> have not been yet implemented in
function <code>acq_fraction_interactive</code>.</strong></p>
<p>A single function can be used for the acquisition of data where the
quantities of interest are expressed relative to a reference. This is
the case for transmittance, reflectance and absorptance. The same
parameters as discussed for <code>acq_irrad_interactive()</code> iare
available in function <code>acq_fraction_interactive()</code>. We will
here describe three additional parameters only present in this function.
The first one is <code>ref.value</code> which needs to be supplied if
the reference target is imperfect, such as a white reference patch which
reflects less than 100%. The default is <code>ref.value = 1</code>, but
this parameter not only accepts numeric values as argument but also
transmittance or reflectance spectra for the target used as reference.
Consequently if the reflectance of an “imperfect” reference is know,
such reference can be used. (e.g. In the case of measuring the
reflectance of very dark objects, it might be convenient to use a grey
reference instead of a white reference). For a reference with 97%
reflectance across the whole range of wavelengths of interest one would
use.</p>

<p>Parameters <code>qty.out</code> and <code>type</code> determine the

<p>Wen using <em>light sources with pulsed emission</em> we start a
session by calling function
<code>acq_fraction_pulsed_interactive()</code> instead of
<code>acq_fraction_interactive</code> and we set manually the
integration time as when measuring spectral fluence. In other respects
the procedure is similar to that for continuous light sources except for
the need to either manually or automatically trigger the light
pulses.</p>

<div id="rolling-your-own" class="section level2">
<h2>Rolling your own</h2>
<p>The functions for interactive acquisition of spectral data described
above, although useful in many cases, are meant also as examples. In
cases of routine measurements one could simplify menus by removing
entries that are not needed, or even converting the functions to
non-interactive, and possibly adding support for scheduled sequences of
spectral data acquisitions. This should be fairly simple, not requiring
advanced knowledge of the R language as we export the lower level
functions that can be used as building blocks for new variations. It
should be even possible to use these functions to develop a user
interface based of package ‘shinny’.</p>

<div id="using-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>Using scripts</h2>
<p>It is also possibly to combine lower level functions using R scripts
instead of through writing higher level R functions from them. Several
example scripts are included with the package. I recommend that you open
them, and save them to your own working directory before sourcing them
or editing them.</p>
<p>You will need first to locate where in your computer’s file system
the ‘ooacquire’ package is installed, and where the file you are
interested in is, and to copy it to your own workspace. Here we copy the
