\title{ooacquire: Acquire Data from OO Spectrometers}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Functions to acquire data directly from Ocean Optics spectrometers, and functions to read similar data files. Functions to convert raw-counts into counts-per-second and physical quantities. Data are saved in objects of classes defined in package 'photobiology'. The instrument settings, instrument description, date-time of acquisition and optionally goecode are stored as attributes.
}
\details{
Processing of raw-counts data adquired following different protocols and
corrections including integration-time bracketing and merging, slit function
corrections, subtraction of stray light and adaptive smoothing corrections.

Acquisition of raw-counts spectra directly from Ocean Optics' spectrometers.
A high level interface to the OmniDriver library for spectrometer
control and data acquisition provided by Ocean Optics for their
instruments. Built on top of the 'rOmniDriver' package which
provides a very thin wrapper on the Java functions giving access to
the proprietary driver.

Reading of raw-counts spectra from files saved by Ocean Optics' software:
OceanView, SpectraSuite, Raspberry Pi SDK, and Jaz firmware.

\note{
This package is provided \strong{without any warranty of suitability
  for any specific purpose or instrument} as it has been tested with only
  three different models of Ocean Optics spectrometers, each with one or two
  of many available hardware configurations.
