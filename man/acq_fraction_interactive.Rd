\value{
These functions return the acquired spectra through "side effects" as
  each spectrum is saved, both as raw counts data and optionally as spectral
  irradiance or counts-per-second  spectral data in an \code{.rda} file as
  objects of the classes defined in package 'photobiology'. Optionally, the
  plot for each spectrum is saved as a \code{.pdf} file. At any time, the
  current group of spectra can be saved as a collection. When a collection
  is created, spectral data are for several spectra are saved together.
  Summaries are saved to a CSV file and joint plots to a \code{.pdf} file.
  The value returned by the function is that from closing the
  connection to the spectrometer.

\description{
Interactive front-end allowing acquisition of spectral fractions using Ocean
Optics spectrometers. Output of spectral data in R data files stored in
objects suitable for use with packages 'photobiology' and 'ggspectra' as well
as plots as PDF files and summaries as comma separated files.
}
\details{
This function can be used to acquire spectral reflectance,
  spectral tarnsmittance and/or spectral absorptance using
  different protocols for acquisition and stray light and dark corrections.
  The protocols are described in the vignettes and in the help for the
  lower level functions called, also from this same package.

  Using this function only requires an Ocean Optics spectrometer to be
  connected to the computer where R is running and the OmniDriver runtime
  from Ocean Insight installed. The connection to the spectrometer and
  selection of channel, when relevant, is done from within these functions.
  A stable and continuous source of light is also needed as well as black,
  white and possibly grey reflectance patches.

  The calculations for reflectance and transmittance are very similar,
  so we provide a single function capable of handling both. For
  transmittance the reference is usually direct exposure to radiation but
  for reflectance a white reference patch is normally used. In some cases
  one may want to use a grey reference. We provide an argument that allows
  the user to supply a constant or a spectrum describing the properties of
  the reference. It is also important to distinguish between total and
  internal transmittance, and between total and specular reflectance.
  In both cases which of these is measured depends on the measuring protocol
  (condition used as reference, use of an integrating sphere versus use of a
  probe with a narrow angle of aperture, etc.) and consequently the correct
  value should be entered to ensure that data are correctly tagged and
  later computations valid.

  A wavelength calibration is needed, but being the measurements relative,
  no calibration of pixel responsiveness is required. A known linearization
  function is also needed.

  Some protocols are available by default. They differ in the
  additional measurements done to correct for stray light and dark noise. The
  default protocols are usually suitable, if new protocols are passed, each
  character vector must contain strings "light", "filter" and "dark".

  By default the integration time is set automatically so that the number of
  counts at the highest peak is close to 1 - \code{target.margin} times the
  maximum of the range of the instrument detector (retrieved from the
  calibration or the instrument memory). The minimum \code{tot.time} is
  obtained by increasing the number of scans. The maximum integration time
  supported by the spectrometer is not exceeded.

  Plots are produced with functions from package 'ggspectra' and respect the
  default annotations set with function \code{set_annotations_default()},
  and default wavebands set with function \code{set_w.band_default()}.

  The different interface modes available are suitable for different types of
  measurements.
}
\note{
Calibration data needs in most cases to be imported into R and
  parameters entered for the special correction algorithms into a correction
  method descriptor. The corrections are skipped if the needed information is
  missing. If no wavelength calibration is available and attempt is
  made to retrieve it from the spectrometer.

  The function is composed in a modular way from functions that can be
  reshuffled and combined with other functions to define new variations
  possibly better suited to users' needs and tastes. Even easier is to
  simply change the default arguments in a wrapper function or in a script.

  retrieved from the instrument, functions \code{\link{get_oo_descriptor}}
