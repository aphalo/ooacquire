TODO

Add test cases. Complete writing of vignettes.

OOAcquire 0.1.2
===============

Add support for OceanView files, and a second set of calibration data.
Rewrite much of the uv_corrections() and s_irrad_corrected() code, and add
support for remapping names of raw_mspct members' to "light", "filter" and
"dark". Rewrite s_fraction_corrected(), and add support for remapping names
of raw_mspct members' to "sample", "reference" and "dark". In the process
fixed bug that was causing overcorrection for stray light in the UVA region.
Added additional data to the descriptor. Changed test for too low signal for
original filter correction to be more permisive, and instead of skipping the
filter correction we use newly added method "simple".
Rename parameter "method" to "correction.method" for clarity.
Add warning for cases when users supply spectra with negative values for
raw-detector counts (electrical dark correction set to true).
Add two new vignettes: Quick Start Guide, and Algorithms.

OOAcquire 0.1.1
===============

Add function bleed_nas() to be used to discard data from sensor pixels
adjacent to saturated/clipped pixels.
Add function for reading data from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Add functions for reading metadata from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Parsing is quite flexible, so hopefully robust across versions of the software
and spectrometer models and their possible configurations.
Add generic s_irrad_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add generic s_fraction_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add automatic support for different protocols including bracketing based on the
the raw spectral data passed as argument.
Add function compute_irrad_calibration() accepting measurements of both D2 and
FEL lamps and the coefficients for reconstructing the emission of the lamps.
Add functions acq_irrad_interactive(), and acq_trans_interactive().
Ensure that all metadata is copied and at all processing steps.
Add example data.
Test and debug.

OOAcquire 0.1.0
===============

First version.
