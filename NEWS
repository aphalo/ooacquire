OOAcquire 0.1.1
===============

Add function bleed_nas() to be used to discard data from sensor pixels
adjacent to saturated/clipped pixels.
Add function for reading data from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Add functions for reading metadata from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Parsing is quite flexible, so hopefully robust across versions of the software
and spectrometer models and their possible configurations.
Add generic s_irrad_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add generic s_fraction_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add automatic support for different protocols including bracketing based on the
the raw spectral data passed as argument.
Add function compute_irrad_calibration() accepting measurements of both D2 and
FEL lamps and the coefficients for reconstructing the emission of the lamps.
Add functions acq_irrad_interactive(), and acq_trans_interactive().
Ensure that all metadata is copied and at all processing steps.
Add example data.
Test and debug.
