TODO

Add more test cases.
Finish writing algorithms vignette.
Document support for OO calibrations and add example scripts.

ooacquire 0.2.0 (2018-10-xx)
============================

Implement support for measuring output from xenon flashes, including use of
such flashes as light sources for measurement of spectral transmittance and
reflectance. Use of multiple exposures per integration is also supported and
the number of exposures stored as metadata is used during later processing.
In the case of pulsed light sources the first conversion of RAW spectra is into
counts per exposure, and instead of spectral irradiance spectral fluence per
exposure is computed. All changes are backwards compatible with raw data
acquired with earlier versions of 'ooacquire' and the user interface remains
unaltered for the measurement of continuous light sources.

* Add function acq_fluence_interactive() for measuring spectral fluence of
pulsed light sources.
* Add acq_fraction_pulsed_interactive() for measuring transmittance and
reflectance using a pulsed light source.
* Update acq_irrad_interactive() adding alternative user-interface modes,
allowing users to set comment and what.measured attributes, and to constructing
collections of spectra.
* Add pre-built calibrations and methods for two additional FLAME-S instruments.
* Improve algorithm for automatic tuning of integration time.
* Fix various minor bugs.
* Update vignettes.

ooacquire 0.1.5 (2017-11-13)
============================

* Fix serious design bug that triggered a fatal error with current version of
'Rcpp'.
* Add functions choose_sr_interactive() and choose_ch_interactive() and edit
acq_irrad_interactive() and acq_fraction_interactive() to make use of them.
* Add fields to the instrument descriptor to store the numeric coefficients
in addition to functions for non-linearity and wavelength calibrations.
* Add pre-built calibrations and methods for our Jaz instrument.
* Add support for irradiance calibrations done by Ocean Optics.
* Add pre-built calibrations and methods for two FLAME-S instruments.

ooacquire 0.1.4 (2017-05-11)
============================

Test transmittance and reflectance acquisition functions against a different
MayaPro spectrometer and a Jaz spectrometer with no irradiance calibration,
and fix the bugs that became apparent.

ooacquire 0.1.3
===============

Test irradiance acquisition functions against a different MayaPro spectrometer,
and fix the bugs that became apparent. Tested against latest OmniDriver 1.4.6.

ooacquire 0.1.2
===============

Add support for OceanView files, and a second set of calibration data.
Rewrite much of the uv_corrections() and s_irrad_corrected() code, and add
support for remapping names of raw_mspct members' to "light", "filter" and
"dark". Rewrite s_fraction_corrected(), and add support for remapping names
of raw_mspct members' to "sample", "reference" and "dark". In the process
fixed bug that was causing overcorrection for stray light in the UVA region.
Added additional data to the descriptor. Changed test for too low signal for
original filter correction to be more permissive, and instead of skipping the
filter correction we use newly added method "simple".
Rename parameter "method" to "correction.method" for clarity.
Add warning for cases when users supply spectra with negative values for
raw-detector counts (electrical dark correction set to true).
Add two new vignettes: Quick Start Guide, and Algorithms.
Remove old sample scripts and rename the remaining ones.

ooacquire 0.1.1
===============

Add function bleed_nas() to be used to discard data from sensor pixels
adjacent to saturated/clipped pixels.
Add function for reading data from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Add functions for reading metadata from SpectraSuite raw data files.
Parsing is quite flexible, so hopefully robust across versions of the software
and spectrometer models and their possible configurations.
Add generic s_irrad_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add generic s_fraction_corrected() with methods for raw_mspct objects and for
lists of file names.
Add automatic support for different protocols including bracketing based on the
the raw spectral data passed as argument.
Add function compute_irrad_calibration() accepting measurements of both D2 and
FEL lamps and the coefficients for reconstructing the emission of the lamps.
Add functions acq_irrad_interactive(), and acq_trans_interactive().
Ensure that all metadata is copied and at all processing steps.
Add example data.
Test and debug.

ooacquire 0.1.0
===============

First version.
